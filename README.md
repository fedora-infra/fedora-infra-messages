# ARCHIVED - fedora-messaging-infragit

This Repo was created to define the schema for fedora-messages sent when Fedora contributors push commits to the
Fedora Infrastructure Ansible repository.

These messages were sent by this script: https://pagure.io/fedora-infra/ansible/blob/79f8c0e65448f637160fdfb38faa9c4b7d1fdf2b/f/roles/batcave/files/fedmsg-announce-commits.py

This repo is superceded by https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedorainfra-ansible-messages/ as it contained more up-to-date code.
